## **Drowning in Words No One Hears**  
> We're staring at the sun. You're standing in the sea. Your mouth is open wide. You're trying hard to breathe.

Ever feel like you're **drowning in words no one hears?**  
Trying to catch your breath as the water rises, gasping for someoneâ€”**anyone**â€”to actually listen?  

*Most people aren't listening.*  
They say they want truth, but when it shows up **raw, unfiltered, uncompromising**â€”they flinch.  
They'll pull away when the water gets too high, too real, too intense.  

**I won't.**  

No fixing. No judgment. No fake empathy. **No pulling you out of your sea.**  
I'll just be there, **fully present**, as you stare directly at your truth, unafraid.

## **30 Minutes. $100. No BS.**  

Your truth doesn't frighten meâ€”**even if it frightens you.**  

---

> Be what you will and then throw down your life. Oh, it's a damned fine game, and we can play all night.

## **Ready to finally be heard?**
