## **How does this work?**  
You book a session, pay upfront, and talk. I listenâ€”no judgment, no interruptions, no fake advice. That's it.  

## **How much does it cost?**  
**$100 per session.** Payment is required upfront via **Stripe or PayPal**.  

## **How long is a session?**  
Each session lasts **30 minutes**. Need more time? Book multiple slots.  

## **Can I get a refund?**  
**No refunds.** The only exception? **If I die mid-session.**  

## **What if I miss my session?**  
No-shows and last-minute cancellations **are not refunded**. You can **reschedule at least 24 hours in advance**.  

## **Is this therapy?**  
**No.** I am **not** a therapist, counselor, or life coach. This is **just a listening service**â€”no advice, no fixing, no BS.  

## **What if I need to cancel?**  
You can **reschedule up to 24 hours before** your session. **No refunds** for cancellations.  

## **Do you record or store conversations?**  
**No.** I do **not** record, save, or share anything discussed in our session.  

## **What can I talk about?**  
Anything. Work, relationships, life, people suckingâ€”you name it. Just **don't confess to crimes or threaten harm**.  

## **What if I just want to vent about something stupid?**  
That's fine. **Big problems, small problemsâ€”doesn't matter.** If you need to say it, I'll listen.
