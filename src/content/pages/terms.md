## **1. No Therapy, Just Listening**

## **2. No Refunds (Unless I Die Mid-Session)**  
Payment is **100% upfront and non-refundable.** The only exception? **If I die mid-session, you get a full refund.** Otherwise, no refunds for missed appointments, dissatisfaction, or any other reason.

## **4. Cancellations & No-Shows**  
- You may **reschedule** up to **24 hours in advance.**

## **6. No Abuse, No Bullshit**  
- If you harass, abuse, or act in bad faith, I **reserve the right to end the session immediately**—no refund.  
- This is a **judgment-free zone**, but that doesn't mean you can be an asshole.  

## **7. Liability Disclaimer**  
- **I am not responsible for your actions, decisions, or life choices.**  
- **No guarantees, no promises, no magic fixes.** You talk, I listen. That's all.  
- **By using this service, you accept full responsibility for your own life and decisions.**
