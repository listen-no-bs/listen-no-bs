There are days when words pile up inside like **shards of light**—desperate to burst out, but you’re not sure if anyone’s truly ready to catch them.

- Maybe your boss is driving you nuts, and you’re not looking for a plan to quit—just to vent.  
- Maybe you’re **tired of being the “strong one”** who bottles everything up.  
- Maybe you’re processing a deeper ache you can’t even name yet.  

**You’re not alone.** And you don’t owe anyone an explanation or an apology for needing to be heard.  

In a world of quick opinions and even quicker fixes, **sometimes the purest relief is a listening ear—no judgment, no “well, have you tried...?”**  

Like the image above—an energetic portal of lines shooting out in all directions—**we all have layers of thoughts and emotions** swirling within.  
They’re not neat. They’re not always ready for prime-time. But that doesn’t mean they don’t deserve space.
