excerpt: The waves don't ask permission to come or go. They just move. The mind clings. The ocean doesn't. No fixing, no judgment. Just presence.

The waves don't hesitate. They come. They go. No struggle, no resistance. **Just movement.**

The mind clings—wants to hold, wants to stay, wants to make sense of the inevitable. But the ocean doesn't cling. It doesn't explain itself. It moves because that's what it does. **And then it moves again.**

How much energy do we waste trying to hold back a tide that was never meant to stay? How much weight do we carry, thinking we need to solve something that was only ever meant to pass through?

You don't need balance. You need **clarity.**

I don't fix. I don't judge. **I listen.**
