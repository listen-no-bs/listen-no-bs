> **Get free or stay trapped. Your choice.**

The past whispers, trying to pull you back. Nostalgia. Regret. Guilt. But none of it is real.

> She never loved meâ€”why should anyone?

The mind clings to old wounds like a child to a broken toy. Drop it. Move forward.

"Move out of California." Sometimes, escape is the only way. Not just from a place, but from a mindset, a system, a reality that no longer serves you.  

I don't fix. I don't judge. I listen.
