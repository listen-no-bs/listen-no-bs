Ever feel like your brain is **running a thousand tabs at once**?  
Like youâ€™re **holding too much, thinking too much, but thereâ€™s nowhere to put it?**  

You donâ€™t have to be in crisis to feel **buried under everything**â€”work, relationships, expectations, the constant need to **keep it all together.**  
But where do you go when you just need to say it **out loud**, without someone trying to fix you, judge you, or make it about them?
