Ever feel like you’re talking, but no one actually hears you?  
Like you’re **there, but not really there**—moving through conversations, through work, through life **with a wall between you and everyone else?**  

- **At work, you’re just another role to fill.**  
- **With friends, you keep it light—because who really wants to hear the real stuff?**  
- **With family, you play your part, say what’s expected.**  

Everywhere, it’s the same.  
You’re **seen, but not heard.**  

That’s where I come in.  

No performance. No scripts. **Just space to be real.**
