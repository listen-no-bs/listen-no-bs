Sometimes you can see the distance stretching on and on, but you have no idea how to deal with the thoughts piling up in your head. You don’t need a polished answer or a roadmap. You just want to let it all out—raw, unfiltered, without someone jumping in to “fix” it.

Most people rush in with solutions, or worse, clichés. But **what if you just need someone to genuinely listen?**  

- **No forced positivity**  
- **No “Have you tried...?”**  
- **No feeling like a burden**  

Here, you can unload all the junk in your mind, just to **clear out some mental space**—no judgment, no interruptions, no bull.
