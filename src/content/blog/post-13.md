Ever catch yourself **buried under a cold, relentless drift**—thoughts piling up faster than you can shovel them out? Maybe it's the small stuff piling into something bigger. Maybe it's a deeper, heavier chill that won't quite melt away.

**Here's the truth:** you don't always need a grand solution or a pep talk. Sometimes you just want someone to stand there in the storm with you—fully present, fully listening, without trying to “fix” it.

- No disclaimers like “I shouldn't feel this way.”  
- No endless loop of guilt for bringing it up.  
- No prying questions or phony reassurance.  

It's normal to feel overwhelmed. What's not normal is never having a safe place to **speak your piece**. That's where I come in.
