![Abstract layered waves, symbolizing depth and space](/post-4.jpg)

Ever notice how most conversations feel... scripted?

- **Friends nod along**, but theyâ€™re just waiting for their turn to talk. 
- **Coworkers smile**, but you canâ€™t actually say whatâ€™s on your mind.
- **Social media?** Just an endless loop of people performing for each other.

Everyone is talking. But how many are actually **listening?**

Thatâ€™s where I come in. 

No scripts. No social games. No pretending to care just to respond. **Just space to say what you actually need to say.**
