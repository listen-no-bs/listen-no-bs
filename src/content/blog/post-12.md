Some days you're sure you're **fighting the impossible**â€”tilting at troubles that might just be figments of your mind. But whether they're real or imagined, they still feel all too heavy on your chest.

Maybe you're stuck chasing an ideal that keeps moving out of reach. Maybe your coworkers, friends, or family can't grasp why you're so wrapped up in what they consider "no big deal." But you know your own struggle bestâ€”**and you deserve to be heard.**  

- No critics telling you you're overreacting  
- No "quick fix" suggestions you never asked for  
- No need to shrink your voice because it might sound "silly"  

In life, some battles need more than just a pat on the back. They call for **genuine listening**â€”the kind you can't always get from people close to you.
