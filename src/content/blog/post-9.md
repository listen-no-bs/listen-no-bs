Some things feel **too big to talk about.**  
Heavy. Unmovable. Like a mountain sitting on your chest.  

- Maybe it's **work pressure.**  
- Maybe it's **shit you never say out loud.**  
- Maybe it's just the feeling that **no one would really get it.**  

So you hold it. Carry it. Push through.  
Because what else are you supposed to do?  

But here's the thingâ€”**carrying it alone doesn't make it any lighter.**  
And saying it? **That's not weakness. That's release.**  

Most people won't listen. **I will.**
