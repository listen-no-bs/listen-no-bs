# Need to vent? $100 I actually listen. No BS.

Life is messy. People suck. Work is a joke. Maybe you just need to talk to someone who won't interrupt, judge, or try to "fix" you. That's where I come in. 

💬 **$100 upfront. Only refund? If I die mid-session.**  
🖥️ **Virtual only – [Book a session now](http://listennobs.com).**  
👂 **I listen. No fake advice. Just talk.**

## How It Works
1. **Book a session** – Pick a time that works for you.  
2. **Pay upfront** – $100 to reserve your spot.  
3. **Vent freely** – Say whatever you need to, with zero judgment.

## Why This?
✔ **No fake positivity** – I won't tell you to “just be happy.”  
✔ **No interruptions** – You talk, I listen. That's it.  
✔ **No therapy BS** – I'm not here to diagnose you, just to hear you out.
