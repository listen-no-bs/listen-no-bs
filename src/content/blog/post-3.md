excerpt: The waves donâ€™t ask permission to come or go. They just move. The mind clings. The ocean doesnâ€™t. No fixing, no judgment. Just presence.

![Ocean waves meeting the shore, black and white contrast](/post-3.jpg)

The waves donâ€™t hesitate. They come. They go. No struggle, no resistance. **Just movement.**

The mind clingsâ€”wants to hold, wants to stay, wants to make sense of the inevitable. But the ocean doesnâ€™t cling. It doesnâ€™t explain itself. It moves because thatâ€™s what it does. **And then it moves again.**

How much energy do we waste trying to hold back a tide that was never meant to stay? How much weight do we carry, thinking we need to solve something that was only ever meant to pass through?

You donâ€™t need balance. You need **clarity.**

I donâ€™t fix. I donâ€™t judge. **I listen.**
